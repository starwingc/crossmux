# UI, Orientation & Input

> Deep reference for [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md). All rendering goes through the
> `GUI`/UITheme macro; all input goes through logical buttons. Hardcoded screen
> dimensions or raw hardware button indices are bugs.

## Orientation-Aware Logic
* No Hardcoding: Never assume 800 or 480. Use renderer.getScreenWidth() and renderer.getScreenHeight().
* Viewable Area: Use renderer.getOrientedViewableTRBL() to stay within physical bezel margins.
* Safe Content: Start from `UITheme::getScreenSafeArea()`, then reserve the active theme's header, spacing, and
  footer metrics before fitting custom boards or grids.
* Coordinate Bounds: `drawLine()` endpoints are inclusive, while rectangle width and height are extents. A
  full-width line therefore ends at `renderer.getScreenWidth() - 1`, never at the screen width itself.

## Logical Button Mapping

**Source**: [src/MappedInputManager.cpp:20-55](../../src/MappedInputManager.cpp)

Constraint: Physical button positions are fixed on hardware, but their logical functions change based on user settings and screen orientation.

**Button Categories**:
1. **Physical Fixed** (Up/Down side buttons):
   - `Button::Up` → Always `HalGPIO::BTN_UP`
   - `Button::Down` → Always `HalGPIO::BTN_DOWN`

2. **User Remappable** (Front buttons):
   - `Button::Back` → Maps to `SETTINGS.frontButtonBack` (hardware index)
   - `Button::Confirm` → Maps to `SETTINGS.frontButtonConfirm`
   - `Button::Left` → Maps to `SETTINGS.frontButtonLeft`
   - `Button::Right` → Maps to `SETTINGS.frontButtonRight`

3. **Reader-Specific** (Page navigation with optional swap):
   - `Button::PageBack` → Uses side button (swappable via `SETTINGS.sideButtonLayout`)
   - `Button::PageForward` → Uses side button (swappable)

**Implementation**:
- Activities use **logical buttons** (e.g., `Button::Confirm`)
- `MappedInputManager` translates to **physical hardware buttons**
- User can remap front buttons in settings
- Orientation changes handled separately by renderer coordinate transforms

**Rule**: Always use `MappedInputManager::Button::*` enums, never raw `HalGPIO::BTN_*` indices (except in ButtonRemapActivity).

## Input Frames and Event Semantics

The main loop updates `MappedInputManager` once per frame before dispatching
the active Activity. Normal Activities only read that shared snapshot; they
must not call `mappedInput.update()` themselves. A second update can erase an
edge before another input owner sees it.

| Query | Meaning | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| `wasPressed(button)` | Press edge in the current frame | Immediate action whose duration does not matter |
| `wasReleased(button)` | Release edge in the current frame | Short action that waits for a complete gesture |
| `isPressed(button)` | Current held state | Long-press timing and transition guards |

Use one physical gesture for one semantic action:

- Use the press edge for a simple immediate action when that gesture cannot
  cross an input-owner boundary.
- Use the release edge for a short action when short and long presses coexist,
  or when the next owner should open only after the gesture is complete.
- After a long-press action fires, keep a handled flag until release and
  consume that release instead of also running the short action.

In the main Settings menu, short presses move one item while a held
`NavNext`/`NavPrevious` gesture moves by a full visible page at the shared
continuous-navigation interval. Settings subpages retain their own input
semantics.

## Activity and Popup Transitions

An Activity, popup, and resumed parent are separate input owners. If ownership
changes while the triggering key is held, the receiving owner needs a
**release barrier**:

- When opening a child while its trigger is still held, the child waits until
  that logical button is released before accepting input.
- When a child closes on a press edge, its result callback arms the parent's
  barrier only if `isPressed()` is still true.
- The frame that observes the release clears the barrier and still returns.
  This consumes the release edge instead of allowing it to trigger the parent.

Minimal parent-side pattern:

```cpp
void ParentActivity::onChildResult() {
    waitForConfirmRelease_ =
        mappedInput.isPressed(MappedInputManager::Button::Confirm);
}

void ParentActivity::loop() {
    if (waitForConfirmRelease_) {
        if (!mappedInput.isPressed(MappedInputManager::Button::Confirm)) {
            waitForConfirmRelease_ = false;
        }
        return;  // Consume the release frame too.
    }

    // Handle normal input from the shared snapshot.
}
```

Initialize a barrier from the held state, not from an edge query: the callback
may run after the edge's frame. Do not simulate consumption with another
`update()`, a delay, or raw GPIO access. Continue using logical buttons.
Touch input remains independent; only arm a physical-button barrier when that
button is actually held.

Settings enums normally cycle in place when they have two choices and open an
`OptionPopup` when they have more. A dynamic enum marked with
`withManagedEnumPicker()` always opens the popup and receives callbacks only
when the selected index changes. Its setter owns the complete change lifecycle,
including persistence, error feedback, and any required restart; the generic
settings flow must not save or rebuild after it returns.

## Touch Coordinate and Gesture Layers

Touch controllers keep their sampling, power, and panel-mount transforms in
the FreeInk SDK. `HalGPIO` exposes the normalized contact, and
`MappedInputManager` maps it through the renderer's live orientation before
classifying direction and edge geometry with FreeInkUI. Activities assign the
meaning: left-edge right swipe is Back, top-edge down swipe is Menu, and
bottom-edge up swipe is Home on every touch device. A hardware Home key remains
an additional input path and does not change those screen gestures.

## Long-Press Pattern

Start timing on `wasPressed()`. While `isPressed()` remains true, fire the
long action once after its threshold and mark the gesture handled. On
`wasReleased()`, run the short action only if the long action did not fire,
then reset the gesture state.

## Input Verification Matrix

Verify the invariant: **one physical gesture, one input owner, one semantic
action**.

| Scenario | Expected result |
|---|---|
| Press opens a child or popup | The child ignores the inherited hold and its release |
| Release opens a child or popup | The child stays open and waits for a new gesture |
| Child closes on press | The resumed parent consumes that gesture's release |
| Long press fires | The threshold action runs once; release does not run the short action |
| Logical buttons are remapped | Behavior is unchanged because no raw GPIO is used |
| Touch activates the same UI | It is not blocked unless the physical button is actually held |

## UITheme (The GUI Macro)
* Rule: All UI rendering must go through the GUI macro (UITheme).
* Do not hardcode fonts, colors, or positioning. This ensures orientation-aware layout consistency.
* Paginated custom grids should call `GUI.drawSideScrollBar()` with their item
  count, page start, and page capacity so the active theme controls the bar
  dimensions and placement.
* INX top-level tabs are owned by `ActivityManager`; only Activities with a
  non-`None` `MainTab` participate. Left/Right and tab touches are consumed
  before the page sees them, while reader and feature subpages remain outside
  the top-level loop. `SETTINGS.inxTabPosition` places this shared bar at the
  top or bottom; touch devices default to the bottom, and the INX home battery
  stays on the opposite edge.
* `GUI.drawProgressBar()` returns the first free Y coordinate after the bar and
  optional percentage line. Callers place following text from that value rather
  than reproducing the theme's font or spacing calculations.
* Functional subpages derive their body from `SubpageLayout::contentRect()` so
  headers, optional subheaders, button hints, and footers have one authoritative
  boundary. Related text keeps at least 4 px of separation, independent blocks
  keep at least 12 px, and custom drawing is clipped to that body.
* `ConfirmationActivity` uses one standard presentation: a 12 pt bold heading
  and a page body wrapped to at most two 10 pt lines. It computes those lines in
  `onEnter()`, never in `render()`, so button-driven redraws stay allocation-free.
* Center a progress state with `GUI.measureProgressBarHeight()`, then use the Y
  returned by `GUI.drawProgressBar()` for everything that follows. This keeps
  percentage text and subsequent details correct when a theme changes fonts.
* Cover views that must fill a fixed frame call
  `GfxRenderer::drawBitmapCropToFill()`. It scales and center-crops through two
  bounded row buffers and returns `false` on invalid input, read failure, or OOM
  so the caller can draw its fallback cover.
* INX front-button hints use black text above a 50% gray bottom line. Empty
  actions draw neither label nor line; directional actions use `<` and `>`.
* INX header subtitles share one rectangle for drawing and clipping, including
  their vertical centering offset. Clipping at the title's original top cuts off
  the smaller subtitle's lower glyph rows.
* On touch hardware, INX list and app-grid navigation focus follows the last
  input modality: touch hides it, while a physical button restores it. The
  logical selection and viewport remain intact, and FreeInkUI's active touch
  feedback plus semantic values such as checks and switches remain visible.

The calculator registers a dedicated built-in Noto Sans 18pt regular/bold family
for its expression and result, then unregisters it on exit. Legacy reader font
IDs (including `NOTOSANS_18_FONT_ID`) resolve to the 12pt offline fallback and
must not be used to select a larger display font. The two display rows reserve
their actual line heights plus at least 12 px spacing; overflowing text is
right-aligned and clipped to the display area. Error messages use the UI font
and its language fallback. Key labels retain their existing font.
The font tables stay in Flash. Drawing reuses the renderer's decompression
cache: the calculator's digits/operators require at most a 14,675-byte group
and 232-byte glyph scratch buffer, too large for the activity task stack.
Only one font-map entry is added on entry and removed on exit; no additional
framebuffer or SD font is needed.

The default sleep screen is Light. Existing saved sleep-screen selections are
preserved; the default applies when no selection has been saved.

## Retained Framebuffer Updates

The firmware has one framebuffer, and its contents remain available after
`displayBuffer()`. A hot UI path may redraw only the changed items, but only
when it can identify the exact frame already in that buffer:

- Snapshot cross-task UI state once at the start of `render()`; never read a
  mutable selection again inside an item loop.
- Track the framebuffer's selection/page in render-task-owned state. Invalidate
  that state before shelf/list content changes, an asset finishes loading, or
  the layout changes.
- Clear and redraw the full screen when the retained frame is invalid or the
  target is on another page. Otherwise restore the old item and draw the new
  item; do not allocate a second buffer.
- After drawing, record what the framebuffer now contains, then re-read the
  cross-task state. If it changed, request an immediate render and return before
  `displayBuffer()` so the stale frame never reaches the panel. Keep the recorded
  framebuffer state even for that skipped panel update, because the next render
  builds from it.

Incremental drawing does not imply a different panel waveform or windowed
refresh. Those are display-driver decisions and require separate hardware
measurement.

### Lyra Carousel home

Lyra Carousel displays one centered recent-book cover in a `380x540` frame.
The complete image is scaled proportionally to fit and centered with white
letterboxing when its aspect ratio differs; it is never cropped or stretched.
The frame is drawn only while the cover row has focus. Its Apps menu icon uses
a theme-local `28x28` four-cell drawing inside the standard `32x32` icon slot;
shared icon assets and other themes remain unchanged.
