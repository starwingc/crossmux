# Apps

The `apps/` directory holds all non-reader sub-applications shipped on CrossMux. They use the Apps launcher (`AppsMenuActivity`) and the conventions below; the main-tab and home navigation expose that launcher.

The directory groups app implementations such as games, tools, reading analytics, and WeRead. The launcher also links to core workflows such as file transfer and OPDS; appearing in Apps does not require moving those implementations into this directory.

```

**Why the `Game*` prefix for `GameUi` and `GameSaveDebouncer`** — these helpers carry save-state and game-board semantics. They are used by Sudoku, Gomoku, and Minesweeper, not by Ugly Avatar (which is a single-shot generator). The name reflects what they actually do; do not rename them to `App*`.

**Why nested rather than flat** — apps share the "Apps" launcher concept and should be groupable. Reader and Settings are top-level features, so they sit flat at `activities/<feature>/`. This is a deliberate structural difference, not an inconsistency.

**File naming inside an app directory** — keep the app-name prefix (`SudokuBoard.cpp`, not `Board.cpp`). The redundancy is intentional: grep, IDE search, and crash log lines stay unambiguous. No `namespace` wrapping for the same reason — class names are globally unique.

## Adding a new app

The dispatcher is table-driven. A new app needs the app files, a navigation method, and one catalog entry:

### 1. Create the app

```
apps/<myapp>/
  MyAppActivity.{h,cpp}   # required — extends Activity
  ...                     # game-specific board / store / generator as needed
```

The activity's `loop()` must handle Back by returning to the Apps menu, not the home screen:

```cpp
if (mappedInput.wasReleased(MappedInputManager::Button::Back)) {
  activityManager.goToApps();
}
```

### 2. Add a navigation method to `ActivityManager`

In `src/activities/ActivityManager.{h,cpp}`:

```cpp
// .h
void goToMyApp();

// .cpp
#include "apps/myapp/MyAppActivity.h"
void ActivityManager::goToMyApp() {
  replaceActivityWith<MyAppActivity>();
}
```

`replaceActivityWith<T>(...)` and `startActivityForResultWith<T>(handler, ...)`
prepend `renderer` and `mappedInput` to the constructor arguments, allocate with
`makeUniqueNoThrow`, log OOM, and leave the current Activity in place on
failure. Do not construct Activities with `std::make_unique`.

### 3. Assign an ID and append one row to `kAppEntries`

Append the ID in `src/AppVisibility.h` and the row in `apps/AppsMenuActivity.cpp`; this is an excerpt, not a replacement catalog:

```cpp
enum class AppId : uint8_t {
  Sudoku = 2,
  Gomoku = 3,
  Minesweeper = 5,
  UglyAvatar = 7,
  MyApp = 17,  // example: use the next unused bit ID in the current catalog
  Count = 18,
};

constexpr AppEntry kAppEntries[] = {
    {AppId::Sudoku,      StrId::STR_SUDOKU_TITLE,      UIIcon::Sudoku,      &ActivityManager::goToSudoku},
    {AppId::Gomoku,      StrId::STR_GOMOKU_TITLE,      UIIcon::Gomoku,      &ActivityManager::goToGomoku},
    {AppId::Minesweeper, StrId::STR_MINESWEEPER_TITLE, UIIcon::Minesweeper, &ActivityManager::goToMinesweeper},
    {AppId::UglyAvatar,  StrId::STR_UGLY_AVATAR,       UIIcon::Avatar,      &ActivityManager::goToUglyAvatar},
    {AppId::MyApp,       StrId::STR_MYAPP_TITLE,       UIIcon::MyApp,       &ActivityManager::goToMyApp},
};
```

Define stable IDs and default visibility in `src/AppVisibility.h`; keep titles, icons, and launch actions in the menu table.

The ID is the persisted bit position in `hiddenAppsMask`: allocate the next unused value, never reuse or change existing
values, and keep conditional-app IDs outside their `#ifdef`. New bits default to visible. Fresh settings hide Chinese
Chess, Minesweeper, 2048, Ugly Avatar, Buddy, Sokoban, Pixel Switch, and Woodfish.
Existing masks are preserved except for the one-time Buddy migration from catalog version 0.
The menu, launcher, and App Visibility settings all read this same table; no `switch` or `buildItems()` is needed.
The visibility mask is 32-bit. `Calculator = 15`, `Woodfish = 16`, and `Ao3 = 17` are stable;
IDs 18 through 31 remain available.

### 4. Add the i18n key and icon

- **i18n**: add `STR_MYAPP_TITLE: "My App"` to `lib/I18n/translations/english.yaml`. Other languages fall back to English; translate selectively. Then run `python scripts/gen_i18n.py lib/I18n/translations lib/I18n/` once locally (regenerated at build time too).
- **Icon**: add `MyApp` to the `UIIcon` enum in `src/components/themes/BaseTheme.h` and add both 32×32 1-bit variants: the pre-rotated Lyra bitmap selected by `LyraTheme::iconForName(size==32)`, and the canonical-orientation bitmap selected by `InxAppIcons::get()`. No 24px bitmap is needed.

---

### 5. (Optional) Stateless toy apps

Some apps have no save state at all. Ugly Avatar is a single-screen generator that creates a new avatar on entry and exits cleanly. It skips both `GameSaveDebouncer` and any `*Store.{h,cpp}` layer, and its `Activity` is launched directly (no `*MenuActivity`). Use this pattern when the app has no "in-progress game" worth resuming; it cuts a few hundred lines and avoids persistent writes.

### Reusable implementation patterns

Choose the smallest pattern that fits:

| App shape | Reference | Reuse |
|---|---|---|
| Stateless, single screen | `avatar/UglyAvatarActivity` | `Activity`, `GameUi` action geometry; no Store or menu Activity |
| Stateful, single screen | `2048/Game2048Activity`, `woodfish/WoodfishActivity` | Board/state object plus `GameSaveDebouncer` or an app-specific idle checkpoint |
| Board game with launcher | `sudoku/` | Separate Board, Store, MenuActivity, GameActivity; `OptionPopup` for in-game menus |

Use `OptionPopup` for in-game action and difficulty menus. It owns touch hit
testing, logical-button navigation, and the inherited-input barrier. Build its
labels when the popup opens, not during rendering. Keep rules, win detection,
AI, and persistence in the game: they are not framework concerns.

---

### 6. Language-independent visibility

Chinese Chess and WeRead are compiled into the unified firmware. The existing
`ENABLE_CHINESE_VERSION` compatibility guards remain enabled by the base and
simulator profiles; do not add a separate Chinese build or source-filter split.

The launcher applies `effectiveHiddenMask()` to combine user visibility and
configured OPDS servers. The settings toggle reflects the user choice even when
OPDS is temporarily absent from the menu because no server is configured. App visibility is independent of the UI language and
content profile. WeRead is visible by default in every language; Chinese Chess
is hidden by default. Language changes preserve the user's app visibility choices.
See [Chinese support](../../../docs/engineering/chinese-build.md).

## UI conventions

- **Launcher layout**: `buildScreen()` uses the shared `UiScreen`/FreeInkUI list, or the existing icon-grid layout selected by `usesIconLayout()`. Reuse the list viewport and `InxGridGeometry` for navigation and touch geometry.
- **Pagination**: the list viewport and icon grid manage their own visible slices. Use the shared navigation helpers and theme scrollbar rather than duplicating row counts or screen dimensions.
- **Header**: each app draws its own header via `GUI.drawHeader(... tr(STR_<APP>_TITLE))`.
- **Result layouts**: center multi-line status/result blocks from measured font heights with `gameCenteredBlockY`; reserve the title bar and button-hint area instead of relying on fixed Y offsets.
- **Back button labels**: the four button hints follow the project standard — `STR_BACK / STR_SELECT / STR_DIR_UP / STR_DIR_DOWN` for menu rows; app-specific actions for in-game screens.

## Navigation flow

```
Home  ──Confirm "Apps"──▶  AppsMenu  ──Confirm row──▶  <App>
  ▲                            │
  └──────Back──────────────────┘    ◀──Back──  <App>  (returns to AppsMenu, not Home)
```

Every sub-app's Back button must call `activityManager.goToApps()`. This mirrors how Sudoku, Gomoku, Ugly Avatar, and AirPage behave.

Electronic Woodfish accepts Confirm and all four logical directions on button
release. Touch devices add taps on the rendered wooden body; whitespace,
mallet, ripples, drags, and the system Back gesture are not knocks. Its
`uint32_t` counter saturates, has no reset action, and is checkpointed to SD
after 60 seconds idle or on exit.

## AirPage

AirPage always enters on its QR page and stays offline until Refresh or live
mode needs Wi-Fi. Network-dependent apps use the shared Wi-Fi picker on demand;
cancelling it leaves the app on its current screen so the user can retry.
Its mapped bottom actions are Back, Settings, Images, and Refresh; logical
previous/next also map the side buttons to Images/Refresh in every orientation.
Touch devices render those QR-page actions as a tappable footer, and tapping a
full-screen image opens the same actions plus Set Cover in a modal menu.
Connecting or reconnecting never downloads an image by itself; only Refresh or
a live MQTT push starts a download.
Settings uses the standard themed list for manual/live mode and the optional
"set downloads as sleep screen" toggle. Images opens a newest-first list of the
current image plus up to 19 archived deliveries; selecting one displays it
full-screen, where Confirm offers the standard sleep-screen confirmation and
Back returns to the QR page.

Live mode runs only while AirPage is foregrounded, backs off failed
connections, and allows normal auto-sleep again after the retry window expires.
Manual mode keeps foreground Wi-Fi available but permits idle auto-sleep.
Downloads are identified by signature and accept BMP or JPEG from the same
endpoint. Exact duplicates reuse the current entry. Unique downloads are
validated transactionally before the old image is archived; JPEG uses the EPUB
aspect-fit, dithering, streamed pixel-cache, and 4-level grayscale path without
loading the full pixel cache into RAM. A selected JPEG is converted to a
fit-without-cropping BMP before atomically replacing `/sleep.bmp`.

## Resource budget

Apps share the reader's resource budget: about 380KB usable RAM on ESP32-C3, with target-specific budgets on S3. Specifically:

- **Heap**: allocate at `onEnter()`, free at `onExit()` (Activities are heap-allocated and `delete`d on exit). Don't hold buffers across navigation.
- **Stack**: keep local function variables under 256 bytes; large buffers go on heap or `static`.
- **Flash strings**: large constant tables must be `static constexpr` to stay in flash, not in DRAM.
- **Storage writes**: never save on every user interaction. Debounce save-on-activity-exit, or use `GameSaveDebouncer` (1.5s window). Electronic Woodfish checkpoints its SD-backed counter only after 60 seconds idle or on exit.
- **Single-buffer framebuffer**: 48KB framebuffer is shared. If an app needs to overlay (modal save UI etc.), use `renderer.storeBwBuffer()` / `restoreBwBuffer()` — see `UglyAvatarActivity::onSave()` for a worked example.

See [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) and the
[resource protocol](../../../docs/engineering/hardware-constraints.md#the-resource-protocol);
apps are not exempt.
